        <h1> Personal Digital Data </h1>
        <p>
          For one week, I logged everything I listened to. I took note,
          of the application I used, how long I listened, where I listened, and
          what I was doing while listening. After recording all the data for
          that week, I turned it into a visualization. </em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By studying my habits for a week, I got a feeling for how much time I
          actually spent on the three apps that I used, which were YouTube, Spotify,
          and Podcasts. To see all of my time, which is LITERALLY MY LIFE, measured,
          categorized, and visualized into litlle colorful bubbles, gave me a little
          more perspective on how much time there really is in a day or week. I also
          learned about how my enjoyment of an app affects how long I listen to it.
          Some content made it easy to listen for hours at a time, while others
          were better suited for a few minutes of my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference in the time that I spent on each application led me to investigate
          each of the apps, so that I could learn the reasoning and cause behind
          my time usage. In the next section, I explain what I learned about why I
          was spreading my time differently between the apps and why I sometimes listened
          for much longer than others.
