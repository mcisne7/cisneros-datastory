        <h1> Personal Digital Data </h1>
        <p>
          For one week, I logged everything I listened to. I took note
          of the application I used, how long I listened, where I listened, and
          what I was doing while listening. After recording all the data for
          that week, I turned it into a visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          By studying my habits for a week, I got a feeling for how much time I
          actually spent on the three apps that I used, which were YouTube, Spotify,
          and Podcasts. To see all of my time, which is LITERALLY MY LIFE, measured,
          categorized, and visualized into litlle colorful bubbles, gave me a little
          more perspective on how much time there really is in a day or week. I also
          learned about how my enjoyment of an app affects how long I listen to it.
          Some content made it easy to listen for hours at a time, while others
          were better suited for a few minutes of my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference in the time that I spent on each application led me to investigate
          each of the apps, so that I could learn the reasoning and cause behind
          my time usage. In the next section, I explain what I learned about why I
          was spreading my time differently between the apps and why I sometimes listened
          for much longer than others.

        <h1> Social Digital Data </h1>
        <p> By observing how much of my time was used on entertainment within the YouTube,
          Spotify, and Podcasts apps, I noticed trends in how long I listened with each app.
          Wanting to get to the bottom of why I these differences occured, I discovered the
          cause to be the recommendations that each service provided. Because of each app's
          recommendation algorithm and the usual length of the content, I was led to listen
          in different ways. Below is a YouTube video which explains recommendation algorithms
          in the context of YouTube and Spotify.

          </iframe>
        </div>
        <p> The larger scale implications of recommendation algorithms make this an
          important topic for the average consumer to be familiar with. Since the technology
          exists to allow you to personalize the content you are exposed to online, as shown
          in the video, it would be wise to make use of it. My experiences are based soley on
          those three apps that I used and recorded for one week, but recommendation algorithms
          are not limited to those apps. I encourage you to look around in the applications and
          media that you use often, and see if there are any places where recommendations are made.
          Once you can identify those, you should be able to use their algorithm to personalize
          the content you see. With these smart recommendation algorithms, you have the power
          to improve your entertainment experience.
